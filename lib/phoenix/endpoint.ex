defmodule Phoenix.Endpoint do
  @moduledoc """
  Defines a Phoenix endpoint.

  The endpoint is the boundary where all requests to your
  web application start. It is also the interface your
  application provides to the underlying web servers.

  Overall, an endpoint has three responsibilities:

    * to provide a wrapper for starting and stopping the
      endpoint as part of a supervision tree;

    * to define an initial plug pipeline where requests
      are sent through;

    * to host web specific configuration for your
      application.

  ## Endpoints

  An endpoint is simply a module defined with the help
  of `Phoenix.Endpoint`. If you have used the `mix phoenix.new`
  generator, an endpoint was automatically generated as
  part of your application:

      defmodule YourApp.Endpoint do
        use Phoenix.Endpoint, otp_app: :your_app

        # plug ...
        # plug ...

        plug :router, YourApp.Router
      end

  Before being used, an endpoint must be explicitly started as part
  of your application supervision tree too (which is again done by
  default in generated applications):

      supervisor(YourApp.Endpoint, [])

  ## Endpoint configuration

  All endpoints are configured in your application environment.
  For example:

      config :your_app, YourApp.Endpoint,
        secret_key_base: "kjoy3o1zeidquwy1398juxzldjlksahdk3"

  Endpoint configuration is split into two categories. Compile-time
  configuration means the configuration is read during compilation
  and changing it at runtime has no effect. The compile-time
  configuration is mostly related to error handling.

  Runtime configuration, instead, is accessed during or
  after your application is started and can be read and written through the
  `config/2` function:

      YourApp.Endpoint.config(:port)
      YourApp.Endpoint.config(:some_config, :default_value)

  ### Compile-time configuration

    * `:debug_errors` - when `true`, uses `Plug.Debugger` functionality for
      debugging failures in the application. Recommended to be set to `true`
      only in development as it allows listing of the application source
      code during debugging. Defaults to `false`.

    * `:render_errors` - a module representing a view to render templates
      whenever there is a failure in the application. For example, if the
      application crashes with a 500 error during a HTML request,
      `render("500.html", assigns)` will be called in the view given to
      `:render_errors`. The default view is `MyApp.ErrorView`.

  ### Runtime configuration

    * `:cache_static_lookup` - when `true`, static assets lookup in the
      filesystem via the `static_path` function are cached. Defaults to `true`.

    * `:http` - the configuration for the HTTP server. Currently uses
      cowboy and accepts all options as defined by
      [`Plug.Adapters.Cowboy`](http://hexdocs.pm/plug/Plug.Adapters.Cowboy.html).
      Defaults to `false`.

    * `:https` - the configuration for the HTTPS server. Currently uses
      cowboy and accepts all options as defined by
      [`Plug.Adapters.Cowboy`](http://hexdocs.pm/plug/Plug.Adapters.Cowboy.html).
      Defaults to `false`.

    * `:secret_key_base` - a secret key used as a base to generate secrets
      to encode cookies, session and friends. Defaults to `nil` as it must
      be set per application.

    * `:server` - when `true`, starts the web server when the endpoint
      supervision tree starts. Defaults to `false`. The `mix phoenix.server`
      task automatically sets this to `true`.

    * `:url` - configuration for generating URLs throughout the app.
      Accepts the `:host`, `:scheme` and `:port` options. Defaults to:

          [host: "localhost"]

      The `:port` options requires either an integer, string, or `{:system, "ENV_VAR"}`.
      When given a tuple like `{:system, "PORT"}`, the port will be referenced
      from `System.get_env("PORT")` at runtime as a workaround for releases where
      environment specific information is loaded only at compile-time.

    * `:pubsub` - configuration for this endpoint's pubsub adapter.
      Configuration either requires a `:name` of the registered pubsub server
      or a `:name`, `:adapter`, and options which starts the adapter in
      the endpoint's supervision tree. If no name is provided, the name
      is inflected from the endpoint module. Defaults to:

          [adapter: Phoenix.PubSub.PG2]

      with advanced adapter configuration:

          [name: :my_pubsub, adapter: Phoenix.PubSub.Redis,
           host: "192.168.100.1"]

  ## Endpoint API

  In the previous section, we have used the `config/2` function which is
  automatically generated in your endpoint. Here is a summary of all the
  functions that are automatically defined in your endpoint.

  #### Paths and URLs

    * `url(path)` - returns the URL for this endpoint with the given path
    * `static_path(path)` - returns the static path for a given asset

  #### Channels

    * `broadcast_from(from, topic, event, msg)` - proxy to `Phoenix.Channel.broadcast_from/4`
      using this endpoint's configured pubsub server
    * `broadcast_from!(from, topic, event, msg)` - proxies to `Phoenix.Channel.broadcast_from!/4`
      using this endpoint's configured pubsub server
    * `broadcast(topic, event, msg)` - proxies to `Phoenix.Channel.broadcast/3`
      using this endpoint's configured pubsub server
    * `broadcast!(topic, event, msg)` - proxies to `Phoenix.Channel.broadcast!/3`
      using this endpoint's configured pubsub server

  #### Endpoint configuration

    * `start_link()` - starts the Endpoint supervision tree, including its
      configuration cache and possibly the servers for handling requests
    * `config(key, default)` - access the endpoint configuration given by key
    * `config_change(changed, removed)` - reload the endpoint configuration
      on application upgrades

  #### Plug API

    * `init(opts)` - invoked when starting the endpoint server
    * `call(conn, opts)` - invoked on every request (simply dispatches to
      the defined plug pipeline)
